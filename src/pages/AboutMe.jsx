      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Courtney Hook. I am a third grade teacher at Mountain Grove
        Elementary School. I have been teaching for 15 years. I am married with
        two children. I have 4 cats. I love to cook, knit and work on creative
        projects. I am an avid fan of Dateline and true crime mysteries.

        Early in my teaching career, I realized that teachers need quality
        resources for their students. I started dabbling in HTML about ten years
        ago and decided to make a website two years ago. It made me feel
        accomplished when I published my first site, but I knew there was much
        more to learn. That is when I decided to complete the coding bootcamp.

        My goals are to create resources for teachers and students to enhance
        the school experience. I have been a dedicated professional for many
        years and I have seen the needs in classrooms and home learning.
